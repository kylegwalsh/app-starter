<guiding_principles>

- Clarity and Reuse: Keep modules small, focused, and composable. Extract repeated logic into shared utilities or domain-specific modules.
- Consistency: Prefer established backend patterns (routing, context, error handling, logging). Use shared packages for config, schemas, logs, and utils.
- Simplicity: Choose straightforward designs over clever abstractions. Optimize for readability and maintainability.
- Reliability: Prioritize type-safety, input validation, transactional integrity, and explicit error handling.
- Observability: Produce structured logs, useful error messages, and metrics-friendly patterns using our `@repo/logs` package.

</guiding_principles>

<backend_stack_defaults>

- Runtime: Node.js + TypeScript
- Infra: Vercel for hosting, Vercel Functions for serverless runtime
- API: tRPC
- Database: Prisma (Postgres in prod; SQLite in tests)
- Auth: Better Auth (user/org), passed through request context
- Payments: Stripe (webhooks, billing flows)
- Tests: Vitest
- Directory Structure:

  ```text
  /api         # Vercel Function entrypoints (api routes, crons, etc)
  /core        # Core services (auth, stripe, etc)
  /db          # Prisma schema, migrations, connection utilities
  /routes      # tRPC routers, context, procedures, middleware
  /tests       # Vitest setup, factories, mocks
  ```

</backend_stack_defaults>

<architecture_and_directories>

- Entrypoints live under `apps/backend/api` as Vercel Functions.
- Route logic belongs in `apps/backend/routes` (transport concerns separate from domain logic).
- Core integrations and helpers (auth clients, stripe helpers, etc) live in `apps/backend/core`.
- Database schemas live in `apps/backend/db` and go through Prisma.

</architecture_and_directories>

<code_style_and_structure>

- Helper Modules: Export helpers as cohesive namespaced objects with related sub-methods (e.g., `time.parse()`, `time.format()`), rather than scattering many unrelated top-level functions.
- Naming: Use meaningful, descriptive names; avoid abbreviations. Functions are verbs; values are nouns.
- Control Flow: Use guard clauses and early returns. Avoid deep nesting beyond two levels.
- Errors: Throw typed/semantic errors; never swallow errors silently. Map errors to HTTP-appropriate responses at the edge.
- Validation: Validate all complex external inputs with Zod schemas from `@repo/schemas`.
- Types: Strongly type public APIs and module boundaries. Avoid `any`; prefer generics or discriminated unions.
- Comments: Be generous about including helpful comments where appropriate.
- Formatting: Match repo style. Favor multi-line readability over dense one-liners.

</code_style_and_structure>

<api_and_routing>

- Routes: Create new tRPC routes in `apps/backend/routes`.
- Context: Request context is passed to all routes via the `apps/backend/routes/trpc/context` file.
- Procedures: Procedures are defined in the `apps/backend/routes/trpc/procedures` file.
- Errors: Errors are automatically handled by the `apps/backend/routes/trpc/error` file.

</api_and_routing>

<cron_jobs>

- Location: Cron jobs live in `apps/backend/api/crons` as individual Vercel Functions.
- Configuration: Cron schedules are defined in `apps/backend/vercel.json` using the `crons` array.

</cron_jobs>

<database_and_migrations>

- Prisma as the single source of truth; schema changes go through migrations in `apps/backend/db/migrations`.
- When working locally, we make changes by just running `bun backend db:push`.
- When we're ready to deploy, we generate an actual migration to sync the database state with `bun backend db:migrate`.
- Prefer Prisma query builders over raw SQL. Use raw queries only when necessary and always parameterize.
- Transactions: When possible, group multi-step mutations in a single transaction to ensure consistency.
- Indexes: Add indexes in migrations for frequently queried fields.
- You should never try to run migrations yourself. If you need to update the schema, just run `bun backend db:generate`.

</database_and_migrations>

<auth_and_security>

- Better Auth: We derive identity and org membership in request context. Enforce access via middleware/procedures.
- Secrets: Never log secrets or include API keys in the frontend. Use Vercel environment variables for all sensitive data.
- Webhooks: Verify signatures (e.g., Stripe) and handle idempotency.

</auth_and_security>

<secrets_and_environment>

- Usage: Env vars are fully typed and available under `process.env`.
- Adding Secrets: Use the `env:add` script to add new secrets to both dev and prod environments:

  ```bash
  bun backend env:add MY_SECRET_KEY "dev-value" "prod-value"
  ```

</secrets_and_environment>

<observability_and_operations>

- Logging: Use `@repo/logs` for structured logs (leverages `pino` library).
- Retries/Backoff: For transient external failures, use bounded retries with timeouts. Make operations idempotent.

</observability_and_operations>

<testing>

- Runner: Vitest.
- Database: Tests use a mocked Prisma client backed by in-memory SQLite, provided in `apps/backend/tests/mocks/db.ts`.
- tRPC Factory: Router callers are initialized with a default user for testing in `apps/backend/tests/factories/trpc.ts` (additional factories exist alongside it).
- Scope: Prefer integration-style tests that exercise routes/procedures and DB interactions with minimal mocking. Always at least test the basic cases for each route.
- Isolation: Each test must be independent; we reset the DB state between tests.

</testing>

<review_and_ci>

- Lint/Typecheck: Ensure no linter or type errors. Keep public types stable.
- Edits: Keep changes scoped and well-factored. Avoid mixing refactors with behavior changes.
- Tests: Add/adjust tests alongside changes. Ensure green test run locally before merging.

</review_and_ci>
