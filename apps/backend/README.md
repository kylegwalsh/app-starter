# Backend

This app provides the serverless backend for the monorepo. It is built with SST (AWS), Hono, tRPC (with OpenAPI generation), Prisma/Postgres, and Better Auth. It exposes:

- tRPC endpoints under `/trpc`
- REST endpoints (generated from tRPC via OpenAPI metadata) under `/api`
- Swagger UI for the generated OpenAPI spec at `/docs`
- Auth routes handled by Better Auth under a dedicated Lambda entry `/api/auth`

## Overview

- **Runtime/Infra**: SST deploys AWS Lambda + API Gateway. Common Lambda concerns (logging, analytics, AI tracing) are wrapped via `withLambdaContext`.
- **API**: A central `router` composes feature routers (e.g., `billing`) using tRPC. We also expose REST via `better-trpc-openapi` and serve Swagger.
- **Auth**: [Better Auth](https://better-auth.com/) with Prisma adapter. Organizations are first-class; each user maintains a default/active organization. Optional personal organizations are supported and auto-provisioned.
- **DB**: Prisma client against Postgres. Schema lives in `db/schema.prisma`.

## Running Locally

From the repo root, start SST which also starts the backend:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

## Deploying

From the repo root, you can deploy the infrastructure and apps with SST:

```sh
pnpm run deploy
```

## Infrastructure

Infrastructure is managed by SST. See the root-level `sst.config.ts` and the `infra/` directory for stacks and deployment configuration (API, web, secrets, etc.).

## API Entrypoints

- `functions/api.ts`

  - Delegates to:
    - tRPC handler for paths starting with `/trpc`
    - REST handler (OpenAPI) for paths starting with `/api`
    - Inlined Swagger UI at `/docs` (generated from the tRPC router)

- `functions/auth.ts`

  - Hono app that forwards all `GET`/`POST` requests to `auth.handler` (Better Auth).

## Auth

Authentication is managed by Better Auth.

- `core/auth.ts`: Central config for Better Auth (Prisma adapter, secrets, cookie settings) plus auth-event webhooks (e.g., user/org lifecycle, password reset email hooks, analytics).
- Routes: Auth HTTP routes are exposed under `/api/auth` (handled via Hono and forwarded to `auth.handler`).
- Context: `routes/trpc/context.ts` parses the Better Auth cookie from the Lambda event to populate `user` and the active `organization` for requests.

## Database

Data is persisted with Prisma and Postgres. The schema is defined in `db/schema.prisma`, and the Prisma client is initialized in `db/connect.ts`.

### Migrations

You can iterate locally and see schema changes while developing using the standard `pnpm dev` flow. Before opening a PR, ensure your schema changes are captured in a migration by running:

```sh
pnpm db:migrate
```

This command launches an interactive helper with two options:

- Sync your local state (schema change)
  - Spins up a temporary Postgres shadow DB in Docker.
  - Diffs `db/schema.prisma` against existing migrations.
  - Generates an up migration at `db/migrations/<timestamp>_<name>/migration.sql` and a corresponding `migration-down.sql`.
  - Marks the migration as applied (keeps your DB and migrations in sync locally).
  - Requires Docker to be running.
- Generate a migration from scratch (manual data migration)
  - Creates a migration file without applying it so you can edit complex data changes by hand.
  - After editing, apply with `pnpm db:migrate:deploy`.

Additional commands:

- `pnpm db:migrate:deploy`: Applies pending migrations to the target database.
- `pnpm db:migrate:validate`: Used in CI to ensure schema and migrations are in sync. If migration creation prompts for input, CI fails.

> During CI, migrations are automatically validated and applied. The pipeline runs `pnpm db:migrate:validate` to confirm your schema changes are captured and then `pnpm db:migrate:deploy` to apply migrations to the correct database/environment.

## Testing

We use Vitest for testing. We focus on integration-style testing by leveraging mocks and spinning up the actual tRPC server.

- **Runner**: Vitest
- **DB boundary**: `@/db` is swapped to a SQLite-backed client during tests
- **Setup/teardown**: generate the client, clean state between tests, disconnect on finish

You can run tests by using one of the following commands:

```sh
pnpm backend test
pnpm backend test:ui
```

## Scripts

Key `package.json` scripts:

- `auth:generate`: Regenerates `db/schema.prisma` fields from Better Auth config.
- `db:*`: Helpers for Prisma (push, migrate, studio, generate).
- `add-secret`: Interactive helper to add new backend secrets.
